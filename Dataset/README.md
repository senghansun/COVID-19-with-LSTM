# COVID-19 Datasets

There are 10 different countries being considered in the project. Those countries were selected since they have the highest total vaccinations number on the last observed date, i.e. 31 March 2021.

All the data are taken from *JHU CSSE COVID-19 Data*. https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
