# COVID-19 with LSTM

### An LSTM Based Analysis on COVID-19 Confirmed Cases Before and After Mass Vaccination Program

As a major public health threat, the COVID-19 disease has affected every aspect of our life. It has infected more than 410 million people around the world and taken the life of almost 5.9 million of them in around one year (per February 2022). The mass vaccination program as a global response to this threat has been started and administered in many countries. However, one emerging question arouse, will the COVID-19 vaccines really work in combating the disease?
In this project, we are trying to predict the future number of COVID-19 confirmed cases on top ten countries with the highest total vaccinations around the world.
This repository contains all the project codes, revision history, and data samples used in the project.
We welcome any comments, suggestions, and questions which can be addressed to the email provided below.
